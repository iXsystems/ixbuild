pcbsd-build
===========

Scripts for the following

 * PC-BSD Builds -  ISO / regression test
 * FreeNAS Builds - ISO / regression test
 * Jenkins automation


PC-BSD Builds
============

This program will do the compile of a FreeBSD world / kernel, 
fetch packages from the PC-BSD PKGNG CDN and assemble an ISO file. 

Requirements:

 - FreeBSD 10.1 or higher
 - A PKGNG repo for the target version / arch
 - git
 - zip
 - grub-mkrescue
 - xorriso
 - poudriere (optional)
 - unicode.pf2 (required for grub-mkrescue)

Getting Started:

First, cd to the "pcbsd" sub-directory and make a copy of the following:

pcbsd.cfg.dist -> pcbsd.cfg
pkg.conf.dist -> pkg.conf

Next, you will want to edit pcbsd.cfg and check that the options are correct
for the version of PC-BSD you plan on building.

If you are going to be pulling PKGNG packages from repo other than the
default PC-BSD repo, you will need to replace pkg.conf / pkg-pubkey.cert
with your own versions.

To start a build, run "make" in the source directory. FreeBSD sources will be 
downloaded from GIT automatically, and then a world / kernel built. Once
this build finishes, the builder will begin fetching packages from the 
pkgng repo specified in pkg.conf. Lastly the ISO will be built in the ~/iso
directory.

Before you can run "make image" you must have unicode.pf2 in /usr/local/share/grub/.
You can copy /boot/grub/pcbsdfont.pf2 if you have PC-BSD installed.  

/boot/grub/pcbsdfont.pf2 -> /usr/local/share/grub/unicode.pf2

Alternatively you may fetch pcbsdfont.pf2 from PC-BSD github.


Advanced Usage:

The following "make" targets are available:

all
---

Will create the FreeBSD world, fetch packages or build ports from poudriere,
and then assemble an ISO file.

world
---

Will update the FreeBSD git repo and rebuild the FreeBSD world environment

ports
---

Will rebuild the local ports / pkgng repo, using poudriere, if enable in
pcbsd.cfg

ports-meta-only
---

Will do a poudriere build of just the PC-BSD specific meta-ports for creating
an ISO file, not the entire ports tree

ports-update-all
---

Will update the ports tree used by poudriere with portsnap and the pcbsd
build-files/ports-overlay directory in git.

ports-update-pcbsd
---

Will update the ports tree used by poudriere with the latest in the pcbsd
build-files/ports-overlay directory in git.

image
---

Will create a new ISO file from the local FreeBSD dist files and packages
from either local poudreire or remote PKGNG repo.

menu
---

Will launch a dialog-based menu with access to all the listed make targets

clean
---

Will cleanup any temp files in ${PROGDIR}/tmp

vm
---

Will create VM images of PC-BSD / TrueOS for VirtualBox / VMWare and raw disk


FreeNAS Builds
============

Getting Started:

First, cd to the "freenas" sub-directory and make a copy of the following:

freenas.cfg.dist -> freenas.cfg

Next, you will want to edit freenas.cfg and check that the options are correct
for the version of FreeNAS you plan on building.

Once that file is created with the correct values, you can run the following
"make" commands to start a build:

iso
---
Build FreeNAS ISOs / update files from sources, this may take a while

tests
---
Run the regression testing framework. Will generate auto-install ISOs and
install them into a VM for testing purposes

all
---
Create the ISO files and run the testing framework to check for regressions



Jenkins Automation
============

Jenkins helper automation scripts, these are used by PC-BSD to handle
the running of jobs from Jenkins on any random builder, while storing
temp files and finished products on another system for easy access.

Usage:

Copy build.conf.dist -> build.conf and set the values for your storage server
to allow nodes to run sftp and sync data between them. Your nodes will need
to have SSH setup to access this system already. 

./jenkins.sh <world/jail/ports/iso/vm/freenas/freenas-tests> <version> <edge/production>
